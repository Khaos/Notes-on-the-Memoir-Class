\chapter{Preface}

    From personal experience and also from lurking on the \url{comp.text.tex}
newsgroup the major problems with using LaTeX are related to document
design. Some years ago most questions on \texttt{ctt} were answered by
someone providing a piece of code that solved a particular problem, and
again and again. More recently these questions are answered along the
lines of `Use the ---------{} package', and again and again.

    I have used many of the more common of these packages but my filing system
is not always well ordered and I tend to mislay the various user manuals,
even for the packages I have written. The \Pclass{memoir} class is an attempt
to integrate some of the more design-related packages with the LaTeX
\Pclass{book} class. I chose the \Pclass{book} class as the \Pclass{report} class
is virtually identical to \Pclass{book}, except that \Pclass{book} does
not have an \Ie{abstract} environment while \Pclass{report} does; however it is 
easy to fake an \Ie{abstract} if it is needed. With a little bit of tweaking,
\Pclass{book} class documents can be made to look just like \Pclass{article}
class documents, and the \Pclass{memoir} class is designed with tweaking very
much in mind.
